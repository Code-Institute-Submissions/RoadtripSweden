# På Vägen Read Me File
A data repository for displaying a well navigated website to inspire for a roadtrip in Sweden and Norway. The webpage includes a description 
about different sides of Sweden, the north and Stockholm area for example. With different media tools of video and images it provides a good
imagination of what such a roadtrip could look like. The google maps help the reader to understand distances and different scenaries. 

# UX

## Users
Expected users of the website include nature interested viewers that want to plan a holiday without flying anywhere and be more free of where they want to go.
The website only provides a small perspective on what road travels in Sweden has to offer, but not all of them, because there would be too many. It is a motivation 
show people that other travels that can be much more sustainable than flying or taking a big cruise ship exists.

## User Stories
* A person user wants to learn more about possible travel ideas around Stockholm and the northern part of Scandinavia (Sweden + Norway).
* These people can use the google maps to have an initial understanding of distances and how much they could maybe do in a day (Stockholm travels) or in a week (Norrland travels).
* Lastly the viewers have the chance to leave a note to maybe show how much they liked their travels, or do give feedback on what other things the website should include. 

## Design
Colour scheme consists of four colours
Simpler Lime Green: ![#7dce94]
Scuffed Dark Grey: ![#3d3d3f]
Vanilla Grey: ![#f6f5f3]
White-ish: ![#f9f8fd]
The colours represent a modern, but not too aggressive colour scheme that goes hand in hand with the pictures chosen for this website.
The green respresents a familiar color to nature while the dark grey is a good contrast to it and the different white tones underline 
the harmony between all four colors. 
Font families include:
Montserra : used mostly throughout the website
Comforrta: used for header & footer; headlines and to sometimes build a contrast if there is too much Montserra.
Both fonts are quite similar, which is stimulating to the reader and doesn't take too much focus away from what is presented. 

## Mockups
The homepage is a single page with a navigation bar that helps the users to find what they are looking for quickly and different features 
that will be further explained in the next chapter. Figma was used for wireframes that you can see here https://www.figma.com/file/41SRkQCEbVzvx4wuN1DCud/RoadtripSweden?node-id=0%3A1 - automatic!
